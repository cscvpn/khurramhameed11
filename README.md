## Deploying Cisco Secure Client

Cisco Secure Client — formerly known as AnyConnect — provides secure remote access for end users. It delivers robust security features and reliable connectivity for corporate networks. This guide covers the deployment process, configuration steps, and common troubleshooting practices.

## Cisco Secure Client Deployment Methods

How you deploy Cisco Secure Client depends on your organization’s infrastructure and requirements:

> **Predeployment**: Installed manually or via enterprise-grade software distribution tools (SMS).

> **Web Deployment**: The client is automatically installed when a user connects to supported devices like Secure Firewall ASA, ISE, or Threat Defense.

> **Cloud Management Deployment**: Managed and deployed through the Cisco Secure Client Cloud Management service.

Each approach has its own benefits and prerequisites, explained in detail in the sections ahead.

## Predeploying Cisco Secure Client

Predeployment means installing Cisco Secure Client either manually or through enterprise software management solutions.

### Predeployment Steps:

1. **Download the Predeployment Package**

   * Available from Cisco’s official portal.

2. **Install the Required Modules**

   * VPN
   * Network Access Manager
   * ISE Posture
   * Network Visibility Module

3. **Distribute Configuration Profiles**

   * Profiles must be kept consistent across all client endpoints and headend devices (ASA, ISE).

4. **Deploy Using SCCM or Similar Tools**

   * Use SMS platforms such as SCCM for smooth rollout.

5. **Verify Installation Success**

   * Confirm that the client is installed and operational.

## Web Deploying Cisco Secure Client

With web deployment, Cisco Secure Client is installed when users connect to a headend device like ASA or ISE.

### Web Deployment Procedure:

1. **Upload the installer package to ASA or ISE.**
2. **Set up deployment policies and configurations on the headend device.**
3. **Users log into the headend web portal to start the download.**
4. **Installation completes automatically after connection.**

> \[!info] **Note:** Web deployment requires an active internet connection and access to the headend system.

## Updating Cisco Secure Client Software and Profiles

Keeping Cisco Secure Client current is essential for maintaining security, stability, and compatibility.

### Update Methods:

* **Automatic Update via ASA or ISE**

  * Updates are delivered during VPN sessions.

* **Manual Update**

  * Users manually download and install updates from Cisco’s website.

* **Enterprise Software Management Update**

  * Updates are centrally deployed using an SMS platform.

## Configuring Cisco Secure Client Modules

Cisco Secure Client includes multiple modules that can be tailored to align with your organization’s security policies.

### Available Modules:

* **VPN Module**: Ensures secure remote access to the network.
* **Network Access Manager**: Handles and enforces network access control.
* **ISE Posture**: Confirms endpoint compliance with defined security rules.
* **Network Visibility Module (NVM)**: Gathers network telemetry for monitoring.
* **Umbrella Roaming Security Module**: Adds DNS-layer protection via Cisco Umbrella.

### VPN Module Configuration:

```xml
<VPNProfile>
    <ServerList>
        <HostEntry>
            <HostName>vpn.company.com</HostName>
            <HostAddress>192.168.1.1</HostAddress>
        </HostEntry>
    </ServerList>
</VPNProfile>
```

## Managing Profiles and Policies

Profiles and policies define how Cisco Secure Client adheres to organizational security standards.

### Profile Management:

* **VPN Profiles**: Specify server details and authentication settings.
* **ISE Posture Profiles**: Define device compliance requirements.
* **Network Visibility Profiles**: Configure telemetry data collection.

### Policy Management:

* Managed via **ASA, ISE, or the Secure Client Cloud Management platform**.
* Policies govern access levels, authentication methods, and security rules.

## Security and Compliance Considerations

Cisco Secure Client offers multiple security features to safeguard devices and corporate infrastructure.

### Key Security Features:

* **Multi-factor Authentication (MFA)**: Adds an extra verification step for identity.
* **Endpoint Compliance Checks**: Verifies devices meet security guidelines.
* **Encrypted Communication**: Utilizes SSL and IPsec to protect data in transit.

> \[!important] **Only allow VPN access from devices that comply with your organization’s security policies.**

## Troubleshooting Cisco Secure Client

If you encounter problems, start with these basic troubleshooting steps:
